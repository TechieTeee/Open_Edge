# Open Edge

## Introduction

Open Edge is an innovative Rust-based project that integrates the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), Rust and Zenoh middleware for cutting-edge edge computing solutions. The primary objective is to offer a robust platform for integrating decentralized credential management with the advanced capabilities of edge computing and blockchain technology, with a specific focus on leveraging ICP within the Rust programming language. By combining the strengths of Rust, ICP, and Zenoh, Open Edge aspires to deliver a secure, efficient, and decentralized framework that redefines the landscape of credential management in the context of contemporary computing paradigms.

## Purpose

The primary goal of Open Edge is to empower developers with tools to leverage ICP and Zenoh for edge computing applications.
